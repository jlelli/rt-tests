Libdl
Copyright (C) 2009-2010 Dario Faggioli
Release under GPL, version 2 (see COPYING)
Use at your own risk.

ABOUT
-----

Libdl provides what is needed to use the SCHED_DEADLINE scheduling
policy and all its features from an userspace program.
This is needed since the new system calls, flags, etc. that make
it possible are not (yet? :-P) included in the standard library.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

The new interface is only implemented by kernels patched to support
the SCHED_DEADLINE schedulign policy.

Instructions on how to download and compile such a kernel are available
on the development Website of the project:

 http://gitorious.org/sched_deadline/pages/Home


USAGE
-----

To compile the library as a static or shared object:

$> make static or $> make shared or just $> make

To install in the default path (/usr/local/lib):

#> make install

To customize the install path change DESTPREFIX and DESTDIR
in the Makefile.

To statically include the files in your project:
 - copy dl_syscalls.h and dl_syscalls.c in your header and
   source folder;
 - edit your Makefile so that targets where the new interface
   is used depends on dl_syscall.c;
 - compile and install it as usual.
